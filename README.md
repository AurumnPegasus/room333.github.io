# Room333

Project to dump Ï€% of our notes and findings. A blog of sorts.

## To The Contributors

1. If you are adding a collection of notes add them under **Collective Notes** in the Home Page.
2. If you are adding a single piece rather than a big set use **Singular Notes** section in the Home Page.
3. If you are writing on a niche topic try to be elaborate.
4. If you are writing on a well explored topic try to be as precise as possible.
5. If you want **create a References page** and do whatever the hell you want in it. Any random shit can be put in there. But please not on the Home Page.

## Why set this org?

*By Alapan Chaudhuri*

One of the major reasons for the sustenance of the human society is our ability to work together as one.

Sir Isaac Newton once popularly said, "If I have seen further then it is only because I have stood on the shoulder of giants".

Thinking along those lines, this org is my attempt to learn writing academic notes online and share them to whosoever needs them.

Also, this repo is mainly for us to easily access some of our note and findings; for obviously it is quite impossible to have more than majority of them online and public.
