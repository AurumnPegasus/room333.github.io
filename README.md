## Why set this org?

*By Alapan Chaudhuri*

One of the major reasons for the sustenance of the human society is our ability to work together as one.

Sir Isaac Newton once popularly said, "If I have seen further then it is only because I have stood on the shoulder of giants".

Thinking along those lines, this org is my attempt to learn writing academic notes online and share them to whosoever needs them.

Also, this repo is mainly for us to easily access some of our note and findings; for obviously it is quite impossible to have more than majority of them online and public.
